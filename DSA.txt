Linked List
Stack
Deque
2
What is the time complexity of inserting an element at the beginning of a singly linked list?
O(1)
O(n)
O(log n)
O(n log n)
1
Which data structure is used to implement recursion?
Array
Linked List
Stack
Tree
3
What is the main difference between an array and a linked list?
Arrays have fixed size, linked lists have dynamic size
Arrays are contiguous in memory, linked lists are not
Arrays are faster for accessing elements, linked lists are faster for insertion/deletion
All of the above
4
What is the purpose of a binary search tree?
To store data in a sorted manner
To perform fast searches
To implement a priority queue
All of the above
4
What is the time complexity of finding an element in a hash table?
O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
1
Which data structure is used to implement a graph?
Array
Linked List
Stack
Adjacency List/Matrix
4
What is the main difference between a min-heap and a max-heap?
Min-heap stores the smallest element at the root, max-heap stores the largest element at the root
Min-heap stores the largest element at the root, max-heap stores the smallest element at the root
Min-heap is used for priority queues, max-heap is used for sorting
There is no difference, they are the same data structure
1
What is the purpose of a trie (prefix tree)?
To store strings efficiently and perform prefix-based searches
To implement a priority queue
To perform fast sorting
To manage memory allocation
1
Which data structure is used to implement a stack?
Array
Linked List
Queue
Deque
2
What is the time complexity of inserting an element at the beginning of a doubly linked list?
O(1)
O(n)
O(log n)
O(n log n)
1
What is the main application of a binary heap?
Implementing priority queues
Performing fast searches
Storing data in a sorted manner
Implementing recursion
1
What is the purpose of a directed graph?
To represent relationships between objects
To store data in a sorted manner
To implement a priority queue
To perform fast searches
1
What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?
Stacks use LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order, queues use FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order
Stacks are used for recursion, queues are used for breadth-first search
Stacks have dynamic size, queues have fixed size
There is no difference, they are the same data structure
1
What is the purpose of a B-tree?
To store large amounts of data efficiently and perform fast searches
To implement a priority queue
To perform fast sorting
To manage memory allocation
1
What is the time complexity of finding an element in a binary search tree?
O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
2
What is the main application of a hash table?
Implementing dictionaries and associative arrays
Storing data in a sorted manner
Implementing priority queues
Performing fast sorting
1
What is the purpose of a disjoint-set data structure (Union-Find)?
To efficiently maintain a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets
To implement a priority queue
To perform fast sorting
To manage memory allocation
1
What is the main difference between a min-heap and a binary search tree?
Min-heap stores the smallest element at the root, binary search tree stores elements in a sorted order
Min-heap is used for priority queues, binary search tree is used for fast searches
Min-heap has better time complexity for insertion and deletion, binary search tree has better time complexity for searching
There is no difference, they are the same data structure
